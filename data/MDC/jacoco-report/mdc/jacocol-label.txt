mi = missed instructions (statements)
ci = covered instructions (statements)
mb = missed branches
cb = covered branches

    When mb or cb is greater then 0 the line is a branch.
    When mb and cb are 0 the line is a statement.
    cb / (mb+cb) (line 11) is 3/4 partial hit (hence yellow)
    When not a branch and mi == 0 the line is hit (hence green in line 24)
